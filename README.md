## About the project

ðŸš€ Project Goal: Integrating Large Language Models with end-to-end autonomous driving models. This project is supported by [2024 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2024#ideas-list).

## Project Structure

Each folder contains related documentation.
- **carla_llms**
  This folder includes an end-to-end demo generated based on large language models and validated in CARLA.

- **data_parsing**
  This directory contains the original development version, used for standalone testing of all scripts. It serves as the core environment for debugging and optimizing the functionality of the scripts.

- **streamlit**
  This is the web-based streamlit app, packaged for online deployment using the Streamlit framework.

- **carla**
  This directory integrates the model with the CARLA simulation for testing and validation.


- **docs**
  Documentation files related to the project, including blogs and technical references.
