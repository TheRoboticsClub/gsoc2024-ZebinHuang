# About Me

üëã Hi! I'm Zebin Huang, a PhD student at [the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/students/zebin-huang). My focus areas are Robotics, Robot Learning, and Human-Machine Interaction.

üöÄ Project Goal: Integrating Large Language Models with end-to-end autonomous driving models. This project is supported by [2024 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2024#ideas-list) .

üì´ Questions or suggestions? Reach out via email.

## Project Overview

In previous editions of GSoC, we have explored [Behavior Metrics](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics) as a tool for the evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving models. We have also explored optimization of end-to-end models and navigation based on segmented images and commands (see video and [project link](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2023-Meiqi_Zhao)). In this project, we would like to combine the previously acquired knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs), using the projects that we successfully developed during past GSoC editions.

The idea is to integrate an LLM system with an end-to-end autonomous driving model so the user can give commands in text mode directly to the vehicle, as you would when using a real-life taxi (‚Äúplease, stop here‚Äù, ‚Äúplease, turn to the left at the next intersection‚Äù). This idea has already been explored in research projects, and we will be replicating it.
